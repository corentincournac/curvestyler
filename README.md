# Curve Styler

Check out the game! -> https://corentincournac.github.io/curvestyler/

Curve Styler aka the best game ever is a clone of Curve Fever, where style counts!

You have the Score, which are regular points (you get +1 if another worm dies), and the Style.

To get style points, you'll have to go through holes made by the worms.

+1 Style point when you go through one of your own

+2 Style points if you go through one of your enemy

1 extra style point if you get saved by making a hole of your own.



Game ends when a player gets the Score corresponding to the number written next to "Score" and "Style".

Winner of the Score gets +1 global point, winner of the Style gets +1 global point.

Check the "Retro Mode" checkbox to play on a squared board.

When the game looks bugged, just F5 ;)

Have fun !
